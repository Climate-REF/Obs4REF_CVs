# Seems like input4MIPs collection therefore seems Good :  
frequency
grid_label
license
product => BUT missing site-observations ! => create it by hand
realm => BUT too much realm from input4MIPs => remove not use one

# NOT OK 
institution_id are different from input4MIPs (almost DONE missing some in universe) => DONE !

source (None is known in the universe)
DONE ! beside : 

IMERG-V06B-FINAL not found in universe <== lower capitalize PB
IMERG-v06B-FINAL not found in universe <== lower capitalize PB

source_type (ARF. ... source in obs4MIPs are the same "thing" as those in universe !!! ??? how to deal with that !  
==> WAIT until 16 may

# STILL TO DO 

# missing from universe 
## source_type ? obs_type ? 
## insitution 
IMERG-V06B-FINAL not found in universe <== lower capitalize PB

# ESGVOC test ?
WHere is the DRS  ?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FXXBhUh71Hjus557ZTD3EKPi_2zxeLvi1aICXOjVYPc/edit?tab=t.0
 ???? is it good for CMIP7 ????
 is it the latest verison ?






# Note / Add

 Data Reference Syntax (DRS) components:
The DRS is used, for example, in file names, directory structures, the further_info_url, and in facets of some search tools. The following components are needed for obs4MIPs:
activity_id	(original obs4MIPs "activity")
realm		(original obs4MIPs "activity")
frequency	(original obs4MIPs: "frequency")
product		(original obs4MIPs: "product")
institution_id	(original obs4MIPs: "institute")
source_id	(original obs4MIPs: "model")
source_label	(new in obs4MIPs)
variable_id	(original obs4MIPs: "variable name")
region		(new in obs4MIPs)
grid_label	(new in obs4MIPs)
variant_label	(original obs4MIPs: "ensemble member")
version		(original obs4MIPs: "version number")

File name template:
The obs4MIPs file name must be constructed consistent with the following template.

New obs4MIPs file name template = 
<variable_id>_<frequency>_<source_id>_<variant_label>_<grid_label>[_<time_range>].nc

For time-invariant fields, the last segment (time_range) above is omitted.

All strings appearing in the file name are constructed using only the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and the hyphen ("-"), except the hyphen must not appear in variable_id. Underscores are prohibited throughout except as shown in the template.

Note that the last segment of the file name indicates the time-range spanned by the data in the file, and is omitted when inappropriate. The format for this segment is the same as in CMIP6 (see Table 2 of the CMIP6 specs document: http://goo.gl/v1drZl). 

For comparison, here is the CMIP6 file name template:
<variable_id>_<table_id>_<source_id>_<experiment_id >_<member_id>_<grid_label>[_<time_range>].nc

and the legacy obs4MIPs file name template:
<variable>_<instrument>_<processing_level>_<processing version>_<start_date>-<end_date>.nc

Directory structure template:
The obs4MIPs directory structure must be constructed consistent with the following template.

New obs4MIPs directory structure =
<activity_id>/
<institution_id>/
<source_id>/
<frequency>/
<variable_id>/
<grid_label>/
<version>

For comparison, here is the CMIP6 directory structure:

<mip_era>/
<activity_id>/
<institution_id>/
<source_id>/
<experiment_id>/
<member_id>/
<table_id>/
<variable_id>/
<grid_label>/
<version>
and the legacy obs4MIPs directory structure:

obs4MIPs/
observations/
<realm>/
<variable_id>/
<frequency>/
<grid>/
<Institution_id>
<instrument>/
<version>/

Notes:
<version> here refers to the CMOR-assigned version number which has the form “vYYYYMMDD” (e.g., “v20170921”), indicating a representative date for the version was produced for obs4MIPs. For those not using CMOR, the convention must be followed.
