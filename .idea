# Seems like input4MIPs collection therefore seems Good :  
frequency
grid_label
license
product => BUT missing site-observations ! => create it by hand
realm => BUT too much realm from input4MIPs => remove not use one

# NOT OK 
institution_id are different from input4MIPs (almost DONE missing some in universe) => DONE !

source (None is known in the universe)
source_type (ARF. ... source in obs4MIPs are the same "thing" as those in universe !!! ??? how to deal with that !  

# missing for now in obs4MIPs_CVs  
nominal_resolution
region
required_global_attributes
source_type
